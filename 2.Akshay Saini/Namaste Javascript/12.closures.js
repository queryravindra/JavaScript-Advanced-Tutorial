// what it will print ,there is no 'a' globally right and taht x has vanished but it prints 7
// 7

// so here comes closure into picture

// when function returns from function it still maintains its lexical scope

// thre is no x but the function remembers its lexical scope from whree it comes
// when we return function it not only returns code but it returns its closure(closure enclosed function with its lexical scope that was returned) and it was put inside z
// and when you ececutes z somewhere else in program it still remembers a (still remembers reference to a and it tries to find out a which is 7)

// will it still be a closure?
